# Swin-UNet (Shifted Window Transformer UNet)
## Model Architecture of Swin-UNet for Semantic Segmentation
This repository provides an implementation of the Swin-UNet described in the paper: 
**Hu Cao, Yueyue Wang, Joy Chen, Dongsheng Jiang, Xiaopeng Zhang, Qi Tian and Manning Wang, Swin-UNet: UNet-like Pure Transformer for Medical Image Segmentation**
[https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.05537](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.05537)
Use `test_output_shape.py` to verify that the model produces the correct output shapes for all input configurations.
